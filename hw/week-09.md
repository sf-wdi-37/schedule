1. Work on the [rails pet lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/rails-pet-lab) focusing on parts 2 and 3 for at least two hours. If you have finished parts 2 and 3 within 2 hours, spend some time on the challenges from part 4. 


### Wednesday

link to submit [tonight's pulse check](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScicQdZtf2JLFw4O-u618YhNeaJ7sJXVN36ybzO7pnaV359QA/viewform?usp=sf_link): the most complete branch of your pet lab

1. Complete part 1 of the [Library App](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/public-library-app). You'll work on part 2 tomorrow morning.

2. In preparation for tomorrow afternoon, read the [asset pipeline rails guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html), sections 1 and 2.

**As you read, jot down answers to the following questions in your own words:**
- What is fingerprinting, and why should I care?   
- Why does the order of the files listed in the manifest matter?  
- How should I use helper methods to include image assets in my HTML?   
- How should I use helper methods to include image assets in my CSS?  
- I want to use an external library that doesn't have a gem. Where should I put the library's code (what directory)?



### Thursday

link to submit [tonight's pulse check](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScicQdZtf2JLFw4O-u618YhNeaJ7sJXVN36ybzO7pnaV359QA/viewform?usp=sf_link): your library app repo (and your driver's name, if you don't have the most up-to-date code you worked on)


1. Work through the [asset pipeline exercises](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/rails-asset-pipeline/blob/master/exercises.md), including the non-bonus portions of the asset pipeline poem lab and additional challenges.  When you complete the app, slack out one tip that might help others who are stuck, in the group slack channel.

* When you want to precompile, consider starting a branch to try that out. You can see the effect and then switch back to your main branch.  

2. Complete the non-bonus portions of the Library Application, part 2. When you complete the app, slack out one tip that might help others who are stuck, in the group slack channel.  Instructions for the authorization part have been improved, on the class copy of the repo: [updated authorization section](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/public-library-app/blob/master/2_library_users.md#authorization).

3. Review rspec by completing the `Car` class tests for part 1 of [this Rspec Racer training](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/rspec-racer).  When you run `rspec spec/car_spec.rb`, you should see all 3 tests you filled in passing.

### Weekend

link to submit [tonight's pulse check](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScicQdZtf2JLFw4O-u618YhNeaJ7sJXVN36ybzO7pnaV359QA/viewform?usp=sf_link): your asset pipeline poem repo and cars repo links


1. Come up with a [project 2 pitch](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/project-2/blob/master/lightning-pitch.md) for a Rails CRUD app that could [fulfill these technical requirements](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/project-2#core-technical-requirements). Spend some time sketching out your idea to include the stages of progress the application could move through from skateboard, to scooter, to bicycle, etc. Remember, you will be working on this project with a 4 person group over the course of a week. Your pitch will be brief with no slides, but we want you to hit the ground running with some more detailed ideas sketched out.

2. Prepare a [technical lightning talk](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/ruby-lightning-talks) on a Ruby gem of your choice.
